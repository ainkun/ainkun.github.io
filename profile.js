  description: "Reverse engineering, mobile security, and offensive research. From CTF challenges to real-world attack surfaces — always curious about what lies underneath.",
  about: "I'm Hussain, known as ainkun — a Security Researcher and an active CTF player. Competing in many CTFs has shaped how I approach unfamiliar systems: break a problem down, follow the evidence, and keep experimenting. My interests span reverse engineering, malware analysis and development, mobile security, red teaming, and vulnerability research. I work across cryptography, reversing, programming, Android security, and AI automation, bringing a hands-on, offensive perspective to the questions I explore.",
